# Capture-Packets-using-Wireshark

##Objective:

The objective of the "Wireshark for Beginners" is to equip learners with the foundational skills to use Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network packets. By the end of the project, participants will be able to install and set up Wireshark, start packet captures, use display filters to detect specific types of traffic (such as HTTP and HTTPS packets), and save captured data for further analysis1. This hands-on experience is designed to help beginners understand the basics of network traffic analysis, which is crucial for roles in cybersecurity and network administration.

##Skills Learned:

1. Installing and Setting Up Wireshark: Learn how to install and configure Wireshark on your system.
2. Capturing Network Packets: Start packet captures on an Ethernet port and save them for analysis.
3. Using Display Filters: Use display filters to detect specific types of traffic, such as HTTP and HTTPS packets.
4. Analyzing Network Traffic: Observe and analyze network packets to understand communication between devices.
5. Identifying IP Addresses: Detect IP addresses in captured packets.
6. Understanding TCP/IP Protocols: Gain insights into TCP/IP protocol stack and observe HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
7. Locating Specific Packets
